                <blockquote cite="http://www.verseoftheday.com/en/04012019">God's ultimate "foolishness" is His willingness to use the cross to bring others to Him. At first glance, the cross is a hideous and horrible tool. In our human wisdom, we could never visualize using a man crucified as criminal scum to capture the hearts of the world. But God does. The cross transcends cultural boundaries, overcomes language barriers, and reaches across racial differences. The cross is God's demonstration of foolishness and weakness, and through it he conquers death and brings our heart to Him.

            <div class="revelation">There are times in life when we feel God is foolish or weak because of what, or how He’s doing or not doing things for us.  I have 2 scenarios from the many examples in the Bible.
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Think about the Egyptians when they tracked down the Israelites thinking they were trapped at the Red Sea…Pharaoh must’ve thought “hmmm their God thinks He’s so wise, now He’s led them to a dead end let me show them how foolish He is to have led them here…” well that turned out to be the opposite, In Pharaoh’s wisdom God defeated him with His foolishness hands down. Study Exodus</span></li>
                    <li>For the weakness of God, best to line it with David’s fight against Goliath and the Philistines. Not only did Goliath but Saul too thought God weak when using David for that battle. Am soo amazed by how God shows His glory and amuses not only the devil but the people in our lives as well as ourselves by how He turns what we saw as foolishness into ultimate wisdom and weakness into ultimate strength. Study 1Samuel</li>
                </ol>
                My message is that we should trust in God fully (not taking matters in our own hands) because no matter how foolish or how weak the means He uses in the situations we go through; the victory He’s prepared for us will be more a masterpiece against our enemy than our very own crafted victory.
